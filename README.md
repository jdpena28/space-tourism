# Space Tourism Website

A Front - End Practice for fully responsive website for Desktop, Tablet and Mobile with different type of Layouts.

## Built on

- Next.js
- Typescript
- Tailwind

### Challenge with myself

In this challenge I practice the two css approaches on Responsive Design:

- Desktop - First Approach
- Mobile - First Apporach

I have alloted 2 weeks for mobile approach and 2 weeks for desktop approach to complete the design and after that I am going to put conclusion on what is more reliable to do when there is a multiple layout design.

#### Conclusion

In using Tailwind CSS the best way to use is the mobile first approach as tailwind out of the box is a mobile first approach subjectively for me. It has a less class and takes me almost only one week different with Desktop First Approach struggle comes when I am designing for mobile view. Of course this is subjective for each of us preparation and logic comes in way first.
